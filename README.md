# coke-mouse
Coke-mouse is a habit management system inspired by behavioral experiments. It gamifies the balance between 'positive' and 'negative' habits by tracking time spent on productive activities and rewarding these with points. These points can be spent on activities, encouraging users to find a healthy balance in their daily routines.
