## Overview

Coke-mouse is a habit management system that gamifies the balance between positive and negative habits 🔄.

These points can be spent on indulgences, promoting a healthy balance in daily routines.

## Features

- **Point System** 🏆: Earn points based on the completion of positive habits.
- **Rewards** 🎁: Spend points on selected 'negative' habits as a form of reward.
